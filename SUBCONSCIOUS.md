## is it possible to activelly use the sub consciousness when coding ?
It is possible to tap into the subconscious mind when coding. In fact, many programmers report experiencing a state of "flow" or "deep focus" when they are deeply engaged in coding, and some believe that this state involves accessing the subconscious mind.

One way to access the subconscious mind when coding is to engage in activities that promote relaxation and mental clarity, such as meditation or deep breathing exercises. This can help quiet the conscious mind and allow deeper, more intuitive insights to surface.

Another way to tap into the subconscious mind when coding is to take breaks and allow the mind to rest and wander. This can allow the subconscious to process and integrate information in a way that can lead to new insights and solutions.

It's important to note, however, that while accessing the subconscious mind can be helpful for problem-solving and creativity, it's also important to balance this with conscious reasoning and critical thinking. Ultimately, the most effective approach to coding is likely to involve a combination of both conscious and subconscious thought processes.




## is it possible to teach math to the subconscious ?
It is unlikely that you can teach math directly to the subconscious mind, as the subconscious operates below the level of conscious awareness and is not capable of processing abstract concepts such as mathematical equations.

However, there are some techniques that can indirectly influence the subconscious mind and improve mathematical abilities. One such technique is visualization, where you can visualize mathematical concepts and equations in your mind's eye, allowing your subconscious mind to process the information and potentially improve your understanding and recall of mathematical concepts.

Another technique is to use repetition and practice to reinforce mathematical concepts and equations in your conscious mind, which can then become more automatic and ingrained in your subconscious over time. By consistently practicing math problems and equations, you can build neural pathways in your brain that help you to solve math problems more easily and quickly, which can ultimately become automatic and unconscious.

Overall, while it may not be possible to directly teach math to the subconscious mind, there are techniques that can indirectly influence the subconscious and improve your math abilities over time.
