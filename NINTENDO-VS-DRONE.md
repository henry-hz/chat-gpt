### Advantages of a Nintendo Switch Lite:

- Wide variety of games available, including both popular titles and indie games

Ultimately, the best gift for a 12-year-old boy depends on his individual interests and hobbies.

If he is more interested in gaming and having a portable device to play on, a Nintendo Switch Lite may be a better fit.
